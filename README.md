# Color Detection Project

This project uses Python, OpenCV, and Streamlit to perform real-time color detection using your webcam. The application captures video frames, processes them to detect a specific color (e.g., brown), and draws a bounding box around the detected area. This project is ideal for learning basic computer vision techniques and building interactive applications with Streamlit.

## Features

- **Real-Time Detection:** Uses your webcam to capture live video and perform color detection.
- **Customizable Target Color:** Easily change the target color by modifying the configuration in the code.
- **User Interface:** Interactive UI built with Streamlit.
- **Bounding Box Display:** Highlights the detected color area with a green bounding box.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) package manager
